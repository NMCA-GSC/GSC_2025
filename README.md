NMCA Repo for NM Governor's STEM Challenge 2024-2025

2025 Challenge Question
"In today's world, transportation encompasses physical movement of people, goods, and vehicles. Beyond the physical transportation of people, goods and vehicles, information technology such as the Internet provides the movement of data through networks; allowing for the cultural exchange between communities; historical exploration; futuristic speculation; and emotional conveyance. Identify a transportation or information technology you need in your home, school, community or state, and use STEM to develop an innovative solution to meet that need. "
